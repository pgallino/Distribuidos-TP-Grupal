10,Counter-Strike,"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.",1,1

254700,Resident Evil 4,"It's one of my favorite games of all time, and probably the RE that I've played the most, BUT I'll have to give it a negative review until the game is fixed.  The game won't even launch in my Windows 10, even when I meed the requirements to run it. If this issue is fixed in the future I'll give it a positive review, it's not fair to rate something broken as good.  Please, fix your game CAPCOM!! I really want to be able to play it again in full HD!",-1,0
254700,Resident Evil 4,This is a terrible product. It lags too much to do everything. I love RE4 so I'm very disappointed. I guess I'll save up to get a legit copy on Humblebundle.,-1,0
254700,Resident Evil 4,"Slow, awkward and annoying. I dont know why this game is considered the best Resident Evil. IMO its not.",-1,0
254700,Resident Evil 4,  GAMEPLAY IS SO BAD FOR COMPUTERS! I LOVE THIS GAME IN PLAYSTATION BUT IN COMPUTER IS BAD! PLEASE FIX GAMEPLAY,-1,1

7940,Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare,"This is the one that started it all.  Depending on your opinion, this can either be a good or a bad thing.  Before things got stupid...before we got Elysium exo-suits....before we had smart dogs...before we had Zombies....before this franchinse became synomous with 'Adding another number/title to it'...we had this.  Still mindless run and gun and still incredibly overdramatic. The spirit of Michael Bay is alive and well within this franchise even at this early stage.   However, the first foray out of World War II for the series was a refreshing breath of air at the time and the original still holds up very well.  All Ghillied Up is still one of the greatest levels in ALL of Call of Duty.",1,1
7940,Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare,"Still the best Call of duty ever made. -No supply drop ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t -no exo suit ♥♥♥♥ -no weapon variants -dedicated servers -mods. -Punkbuster -no DLC weapon ♥♥♥♥.  Edit: people are asking me if alot of popele play this game still. i would kind of. you should have no problem finding servers. do note that alot of servers are HC so looking for a normal TDM game might take a bit of time. also another thing is that alof of servers are running mods. you wont know which servers because they will show up as normal TDM or Dom servers but they are running mods like zombies, mw2 gun mods,etc you get the point.  overall Get this game if its on sale. you wont regret it.",1,1

252950,Rocket League,4 player split screen? cross platform connectivity? rocket cars? These devs don't ♥♥♥♥ around.,1,0
252950,Rocket League,"Reminds me of the golden days of gaming. No bs, no gimmick, just simply a good game, awesome!",1,1
252950,Rocket League,"So, what makes this vehicular football game so great?  - Great gameplay - Marvelous graphics - Very competitive - Alright singleplayer - Tons of customization - Easy to pick up, hard to master - Up to 4-player splitscreen (!!) - Cross-platform + Much more to experience for yourself!  Cons: - Servers were pretty bad to begin with, but that's fixed now tho', so this should not count as a con.  Everything else that I would have written as a con, is currently being added, so I have no complaints about this game at all.  ''Just one more game'' - everyone.",1,1
252950,Rocket League," Rocket League has one of the best progression systems I've ever seen in a video game before...    Rookie  - You can't hit ♥♥♥♥. You are a disgrace to your team and the game.   Semi Pro  - You can now sometimes hit the ball. Don't even try to hit it in the right direction or think about your positioning. You're only Semi Pro so you can just go ahead and hit that ball! You also made a bicycle hit that one time but yeah nah you're still ♥♥♥♥.   Pro  - You have learnt how to shoot the ball accurately from the ground. You're the best! Late into Pro level, you would have likely looked up advanced tips for Rocket League. Worst mistake of your life. You now know what aerials are. You think you can fly. The ball comes up high and you go for an aerial. Once you jump, you fly straight into the ground and continue to do frontflips until you land on your back... What the ♥♥♥♥ happened there? Oh. You're using keyboard. Yeah nah, time to get a controller, ♥♥♥♥-head.   Veteran  - You now have a controller and go for terribly unlikely aerials. You think you're good. You can hit the lower aerials consistently and you can now be considered an addition to your team. Congratulations!   Expert  - You can now consistently hit aerials accurately at any height. This game is now your life. You can also score off a wall every now and then. Good times.   Master  - You are now a god to every level lower than you. You have perfected the art of wall shots. You are an extremely cool person. A nice little bonus is that everyone under the level of Pro will now spam 'Sorry!' every time they do something wrong to you.   Legend  - The most badass-looking title you can have. ♥♥♥♥ Rocketeer. You probably now have an extreme case of false confidence. Once you get used to the badass title, you'll wreck anything and anyone with ease. You can also pull off freestyles consistently. Nice job! Also be sure to prepare for an endless stream of 'You're not good enough for Legend!'   Rocketeer  - You can now 720-freestyle-backflip-reverse-backwards-aerial-air dribble off a wall with ease. You probably boosted for that Rocketeer tag, but if you didn't: Still prepare for another endless stream of 'You're not good enough for Rocketeer!'  But in all seriousness, I absolutely love this game and I'm sure anyone will. I've literally never seen someone dislike this game after they've played 10 hours. (Rocket League moves onto a whole-nother level of fun and addiction once you learn how to fly.)  If you're still contemplating buying this game after reading this review, just trust me when I say it is one of the most fun and addictive games I've ever played (more gripping than Skyrim and GTA).  Think about it this way: You wouldn't have made it this far through the review if you didn't secretly want this game. Ignore the childish-looking pictures on the store page. Just get this game. This is the one.   EDIT - 2/13/2016:",1,0

252910,Skyscraper Simulator,"This game is a bit slow to get into, the instructions are long and you soon lose interest after building one 'scraper.  It's one of those games you'll play for an hour and think... Well, that's one built, what now. Oh build another one. I think I'll just go back to Theme Hospital.  Not to mention to run this game you most likely have to adjust your audio settings on Windows, to 16 bit at 48000hz...  Why can't I play it at 24 bit, 96000hz is beyond me...",-1,0
252910,Skyscraper Simulator,"I would love to give this game a thumbs up. I really do. Perhaps even raising both of my thumbs high in the air since the idea of the game was a very interesting one. A promising one. The result however leaves quite a lot to wish for. Like, I don't know. A game that actually launches when wanting to play it?   May it be so I was a lucky gamer among few, or so it seems when reading the reviews. For me, the game actually started and I managed to play it. Twice. For a little while. Since then the game refuse to start.   Like most of the ones writing bad reviews about this little.. well, a hole to put the money in and never to have any use for the item purchased.. Like most of them I too have tried every angle I could find on how to solve this issue. All from contacting the not so active support on to the crazy idea of lowering the sound quality to verifying the integrity of the files on to compatibility and even reinstalling the game itself. Alas the game is still as dead as it was before doing the above routines. Perhaps it is a good thing the support never contacted me back. Or it would possibly be as if they.. I dont know, read some 'how to deal with a moronic customer in need of help' guide. 'Step 1, ask if the power on the computer is turned on.'.   If the game company were trying for a real life game of frustration where we are simulating our own emotions and how long it takes before some item of less value - in the near vicinity - takes a bashing from the built up rage. Then if that was the aim for this, good going. I love it. It felt so real. But on the other hand, if they tried to make a game we would buy and feel as if the money was not a total waste. Sorry, you guys did not quite reach that goal. May I wish for a better luck with future projects?",-1,0
252910,Skyscraper Simulator,"This is the worst game i have ever played! Do not buy it at all costs. If you do, you will be branded stupid.... so please don't. Save your money and buy a game that works, a game that does stuff..... a game that you may actually be able to enjoy. Just not this one!",-1,0
